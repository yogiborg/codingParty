    <h1 id="manifesto">My Design Manifesto</h1>
    <p id="lineThree">I’ve created a really wacky path for myself over the past few years.</p>
    <p id="lineSeven"> So much so, I’m not even exactly sure what “design” is<br>or if I can describe myself as an “artist” or not.</p>
    <p id="lineTen">I guess that ambiguity is something that I’ve always taken an interest in.</p>
    <p id="lineEleven">Throwing myself into the unknown, hoping that I’m able to figure out a solution;</p>
    <p id="lineTwelve">because as far as the real-life application of art and design works, the types of jobs that we are asked to do inherently carry the requirement of creativity.</p>
    <p id="lineThirteen">Whether it’s something like “how can we make this space more engaging” or “how can certain behaviors be changed”, these types of questions definitely don’t have an easy fix because of their vagueness.</p>
    <p id="lineFourteen">But finding the “answers” to ambiguous problems allows for creative freedom and in the end, a feeling of fulfillment.</p>
